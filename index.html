    <h3>First, i will start with somethings about my daily life.</h3>

    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes, i prefer to hang out with my friends, go to some outside playground and eat junk food together.
        Besides, we usually go into a quiet cafe, support others stuydy and have a rest after the hustle and bustle in the Capital city of VietNam, where im living in.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ha Noi is a crowded city but HaNoi is one of the best place where people who want to get more knowledge about cuisine. Taken from a famous tourism website named TripAdvisor, HaNoi is the best food destinations in the world 2024.
